# Backend Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a Node.js/Express backend to support the JobRizz resume builder frontend application. The backend will provide user authentication, resume data persistence, AI service integration, and file management capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication & Authorization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create an account and securely log in, so that I can save and manage my resumes privately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers with email and password THEN the system SHALL create a new user account with encrypted password
2. WHEN a user logs in with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL return a JWT token for authentication
3. WHEN a user accesses protected endpoints THEN the system SHALL validate the JWT token
4. WHEN a JWT token expires THEN the system SHALL return an unauthorized error
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate the current session

### Requirement 2: Resume Data Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save, retrieve, update, and delete my resumes, so that I can manage multiple versions and access them from anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a resume THEN the system SHALL store the resume data with sections, template, and metadata
2. WHEN a user requests their resumes THEN the system SHALL return all resumes belonging to that user
3. WHEN a user updates a resume THEN the system SHALL save the changes and return the updated resume
4. WHEN a user deletes a resume THEN the system SHALL remove it from the database permanently
5. WHEN a user accesses resume data THEN the system SHALL ensure they can only access their own resumes

### Requirement 3: AI Service Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want AI-powered resume analysis and corrections, so that I can improve my resume quality and ATS compatibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests resume analysis THEN the system SHALL integrate with OpenAI API to provide suggestions
2. WHEN a user requests ATS scoring THEN the system SHALL analyze the resume and return a compatibility score
3. WHEN a user requests job matching THEN the system SHALL compare resume content with job descriptions
4. WHEN AI services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages
5. WHEN AI requests exceed rate limits THEN the system SHALL implement proper throttling and queuing

### Requirement 4: File Upload & Processing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload existing resumes in PDF or DOCX format, so that I can import my current resume data into the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a PDF file THEN the system SHALL parse the content and extract text data
2. WHEN a user uploads a DOCX file THEN the system SHALL process the document and extract structured data
3. WHEN file upload fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages
4. WHEN uploaded files exceed size limits THEN the system SHALL reject the upload with clear messaging
5. WHEN files are processed THEN the system SHALL store the extracted data in the resume format

### Requirement 5: Data Validation & Security

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all data to be validated and secured, so that the application is protected from malicious inputs and data breaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is received from the frontend THEN the system SHALL validate all inputs using schema validation
2. WHEN passwords are stored THEN the system SHALL hash them using secure algorithms
3. WHEN sensitive data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS encryption
4. WHEN database queries are executed THEN the system SHALL prevent SQL injection attacks
5. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Requirement 6: Database Design & Performance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want efficient data storage and retrieval, so that the application performs well as it scales.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database is designed THEN it SHALL support efficient queries for user and resume data
2. WHEN resume data is stored THEN it SHALL maintain referential integrity between users and resumes
3. WHEN queries are executed THEN they SHALL be optimized for performance with proper indexing
4. WHEN the database grows THEN it SHALL support pagination for large datasets
5. WHEN data is accessed frequently THEN the system SHALL implement caching strategies

### Requirement 7: API Documentation & Testing

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want clear API documentation and reliable endpoints, so that I can integrate the frontend effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are created THEN they SHALL be documented with request/response schemas
2. WHEN endpoints are tested THEN they SHALL have comprehensive unit and integration tests
3. WHEN API responses are returned THEN they SHALL follow consistent formatting standards
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL return standardized error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
5. WHEN the API is deployed THEN it SHALL include health check endpoints for monitoring

### Requirement 8: Environment Configuration & Deployment

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want configurable deployment options, so that the backend can be deployed across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from environment variables
2. WHEN deployed to different environments THEN it SHALL support development, staging, and production configurations
3. WHEN database connections are established THEN they SHALL be configurable per environment
4. WHEN the application is containerized THEN it SHALL include proper Docker configuration
5. WHEN monitoring is needed THEN it SHALL include logging and health check capabilities
